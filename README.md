# Random Paragraph Generator!

This my solution to the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) project [Mixed Messages](https://www.codecademy.com/projects/portfolio/mixed-messages) written in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).

It uses mutiple arrays containing strings to mix and match a few words and phrases together to create a random number of sentences. Simply call main.mjs to get a random paragraph.
